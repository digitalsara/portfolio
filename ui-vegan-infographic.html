        <p class="push-2 mega">Through the dissection of the subject of veganism, this infographic took a life of its own as the lines connected into shapes, and the shapes became our friendly carrot guide. Designed as two dimensional—or flat-style—the illustrations are kept simple to focus on the key talking points about a vegan diet. Earth tones accented with warm orange shades were chosen to keep the design organic. The sans-serif, handwritten typeface brings playfulness to the design, and is displayed strictly on titles. For longer paragraphs of text, a slab-serif font is used for optimized legibility.</p>

        <p class="push-2 mega">When revamping the effectiveness of this static infographic, it was imperative to use the magic of motion graphics. Implementing 3D spaces, index positions, parallax effects and smoothing transitions through the graph editor were used to achieve this interactive infographic mock-up.</p>
