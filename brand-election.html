      <h3 class="exa push-1-2">Behind the branding</h3>
      <p class="push-1-2 mega">The theme of this election branding for Emilie Coyleâ€™s campaign involved clean colours with a contemporary edge. The conceptualization of this election branding comprised of typesetting stationery items (such as brochures, postcards, lawn signs, advertisement banners, business cards, and much more). Motion graphic videos were also incorporated to target her demographic on social media, which specifically includes students and young adults. Over the course of the summer and fall 2018, I had the pleasure to see my work displayed throughout the College Ward in Ottawa, and gained experience in designing for print, social media, and web for a corporate environment.</p>
