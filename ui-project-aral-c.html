      <h3 class="exa push-1-2">What is Project Aral-C?</h3>
      <p class="push-1-2 mega">Inspired by the vanishing Aral Sea in Central Asia, which has been dematerializing by the hand of mankind due to the extraction of all of its resources—claimed by scientists as one of the planet’s worst ecological disasters—, the goal of this project is to educate children on the importance of taking care of our waters.</p>
      <p class="push-1-2 mega">Plastic waste is at a peak. Every year, 10 million metric tonnes of plastic end up in the oceans, with more than 165 million tonnes of plastic floating in our oceans today. It is frightening to read that by 2050, more plastic will float in the ocean than sea creatures. Plastic affects climate change immensely; as the making of plastic begins with fossil fuels—oils and gases— and releases toxic emissions when extracted from the earth. At the end of the cycle, petroleum products (used in plastic) are being burned as a temporary fix to rid our land of the bulk waste. The carbon dioxide this creates is causing a greenhouse effect to our planet, which in return is fostering global warming.</p>
      <h3 class="exa push-1-2">How do we put an end to this? </h3>
      <p class="push-1-2 mega">The approach of this project is to educate children from a young age. How can they sensibly make an impact in decreasing plastic waste, and achieve this in their everyday lives? Children have influence in their households, and the objective of this application is to initiate conversations among family members and friends.</p>
      <p class="push-1-2 mega">Children will find this game a thrill, as it is educational, but challenging all the same. The more waste they can discover, the more points they can score, and the incentive is to save all sea creatures. Kam J.3, their captain, often makes an appearance to guide them and encourage their discoveries.</p>
      <p class="push-2 mega">This application can make a difference in the future generation, as it is engaging, informational, and appropriate to fit their daily lives. Parents will find it pertinent, and will be more likely to keep this app on their phones or their children’s devices than any regular game. </p>
